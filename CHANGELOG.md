## Added 

Some of you use a lot the [PreAuthorization](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/preauthorizations#e183_the-preauthorization-object) feature of our API. To make your life easier, we have added three new events :

- PREAUTHORIZATION_CREATED
- PREAUTHORIZATION_SUCCEEDED
- PREAUTHORIZATION_FAILED

The goal is to help you monitor a PreAuthorization with a [webhook](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/hooks#e246_the-hook-object).

*Example: If a PreAuthorization is desynchronized, when the status is updated, you will be able to know it.*

### On demand feature for 3DSv2

> **This on-demand feature is for testing purposes only and will not be available in production**

#### Request

We've added a new parameter `Requested3DSVersion` (not mandatory) that allows you to choose between versions of 3DS protocols (managed by the parameter `SecureMode`). Two values are available: 
* `V1`
* `V2_1`

If nothing is sent, the flow will be 3DS V1. 

The `Requested3DSVersion` may be included on all calls to the following endpoints:
* `/preauthorizations/card/direct`
* `/payins/card/direct`

#### Response

In the API response, the `Requested3DSVersion` will show the value you requested:
* `V1`
* `V2_1`
* `null` – indicates that nothing was requested

The parameter `Applied3DSVersion` shows you the version of the 3DS protocol used. Two values are possible:
* `V1`
* `V2_1`
